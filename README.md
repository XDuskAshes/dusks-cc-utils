# General ComputerCraft Utilities

A collection of useful programs that have been developed steadily over some time and am deciding to share.

Utilities:

- ``touch`` - Create files at a given location.
- ``cat`` - Concatenate (display) file contents to the standard output.
- ``duskfileman`` - Simple file manager/browser.

### Info on releases

Every ten new utilities, I will make a new release.
